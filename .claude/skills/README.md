## Why This Skill?

**The hard part of creating a skill isn't the format — it's knowing the best way to do the thing.**

Most professional domains have masters who spent decades figuring out what works:
- Jobs on product, hiring, and marketing
- Bezos on writing (6-pager) and decision-making
- Munger on mental models
- Chris Voss on negotiation

This skill surfaces their methodologies before you write a single line, so your skill embodies world-class expertise from day one.

## How It Works

```
1. You: "I want to create a skill for user interviews"

2. Skill-from-masters:
   ├── Checks local methodology database
   ├── Searches web for additional experts
   ├── Finds golden examples of great outputs
   ├── Identifies common mistakes to avoid
   └── Cross-validates across sources

3. Surfaces experts:
   - Rob Fitzpatrick (The Mom Test)
   - Steve Portigal (Interviewing Users)
   - Nielsen Norman Group best practices

4. You select which methodologies to incorporate

5. Extracts actionable principles from primary sources

6. Hands off to skill-creator to generate the final skill
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **3-Layer Search** | Local database → Web search for experts → Deep dive on primary sources |
| **Golden Examples** | Finds exemplary outputs to define quality bar |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Searches for common mistakes to encode "don't do this" |
| **Cross-Validation** | Compares multiple experts to find consensus and flag disagreements |
| **Quality Checklist** | Verifies completeness before generating |

## Methodology Database

The skill includes a curated database covering 15+ domains:

| Domain | Example Experts |
|--------|-----------------|
| Writing | Barbara Minto, William Zinsser, Amazon 6-pager |
| Product | Marty Cagan, Teresa Torres, Gibson Biddle |
| Sales | Neil Rackham (SPIN), Challenger Sale, MEDDIC |
| Hiring | Laszlo Bock, Geoff Smart, Lou Adler |
| User Research | Rob Fitzpatrick, Steve Portigal, JTBD |
| Engineering | Martin Fowler, Robert Martin, Kent Beck |
| Leadership | Kim Scott, Ray Dalio, Andy Grove |
| Negotiation | Chris Voss, Fisher & Ury |
| Startups | Eric Ries, Paul Graham, YC |
| Decision Making | Jeff Bezos, Charlie Munger, Annie Duke |

Plus an **"Oral Tradition"** section for experts who share primarily through talks and interviews (Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jensen Huang, Patrick Collison, etc.)

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone directly (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your skills directory
cd ~/.claude/skills  # Claude Code
# or your platform's skills path

# Clone this skill
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skill-from-masters.git
```

### Option 2: Manual installation

1. Download the `skill-from-masters` folder
2. Place it in your skills directory

### Dependency

This skill works with **skill-creator**. Make sure skill-creator is available in your environment.

## Usage

The skill automatically activates when you ask to create a new skill. It runs **before** skill-creator to ensure your skill is built on proven methodologies.

### Example Session

**You:** "Help me create a skill for writing product requirement documents"

**Skill-from-masters:**
> Let me search for the best methodologies on PRD writing.
>
> *[Searches: "PRD best practices expert", "product requirements document methodology"]*
>
> I found several strong frameworks:
>
> **Product Management:**
> - Marty Cagan: Problem-first PRDs, separating problem space from solution space
> - Teresa Torres: Outcome-focused requirements
>
> **Business Writing:**
> - Barbara Minto: Pyramid Principle - lead with conclusion, MECE structure
> - Amazon: Working backwards, 6-pager narrative format
>
> **Golden Examples Found:**
> - Intercom's public PRD template
> - Linear's product spec format
>
> **Common Mistakes:**
> - Jumping to solutions before defining the problem
> - Writing for engineers instead of for alignment
> - Missing success metrics
>
> Which approaches resonate? Or should I search deeper into any of them?

**You:** "I like Amazon's approach combined with Cagan's problem-first thinking."

**Skill-from-masters:** *[Fetches primary sources on Amazon's methodology, extracts principles, then generates skill via skill-creator]*
